Legal info regarding murder:

Anything well staged to look like suicide or a robbery attempt,

Most cops are merely human and so take the easy road, so make it look like a drug deal gone bad, or auto-erotic asphyxiation, anything basically sordid or embarrassing and nobody will look twice. They will be having too much fun gossiping about it. Just make it fit an existing narrative.

If you want it more personal and sordid, just make it look random. The CIA used to have a method using a special shiv, wrapped with a large handle of duct tape that was tapered on both ends.

The guy would just walk up in a crowd, shove it into the liver or kidney where you will bleed out fast, pounding the hilt in with the heel of the hand. It will plug up the hole and no blood. Everyone just thinks they collapsed. By the time anyone even figures out there is a knife you are blocks away. All they have as evidence is a cheap-looking chiv with duct tape, it looks like a random crazy person or gang thing.

Just make it fit an existing narrative in the mind of the cops and public.
